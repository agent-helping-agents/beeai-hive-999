# GitHub Action Plan with Qwen

Your GitHub (https://github.com/BoozeLee) has no public repos, which limits its appeal for AI/ML recruiters. This action plan uses Qwen 2.5-Coder (a coding-focused language model) to build a standout profile, tailored for your role as an AI/ML Scientist. It follows your instructions: create one Qwen-assisted project, draft a profile README, and commit weekly.

## 1. Create One Qwen-Assisted Project (By Next Week)

### Goal
Build a simple AI/ML project using Qwen to generate code, push it to GitHub with a README, and showcase your skills.

### Project Idea
A text classifier (e.g., sentiment analysis on movie reviews) using Hugging Face Transformers and Python.

### Steps
1. Use Qwen to Generate Code:
   - Install Qwen (see setup guide)
   - Prompt Qwen: "Write a Python script using Hugging Face Transformers to fine-tune a BERT model for sentiment analysis on a CSV dataset."

2. Project Structure:
   - `main.py`: Main training script
   - `requirements.txt`: Dependencies
   - `README.md`: Project documentation
   - `setup.py`: Package installation script
   - `.gitignore`: Files to exclude from Git
   - `sample_data.csv`: Example data format
   - `test_model.py`: Script to test the trained model

## 2. Draft a Profile README

Created a comprehensive profile README that includes:
- Professional introduction
- Technical skills with badges
- Featured projects
- Contact information (LinkedIn, Email)

## 3. Commit Weekly

Set up automation scripts for regular updates:
- `github_updater.sh`: Script to push updates to GitHub
- `weekly_update.sh`: Script for weekly project updates
- `setup_cron.sh`: Script to schedule automatic weekly updates
- `manage_repos.sh`: Script to manage all GitHub repositories with bakerstreet concept

## 4. Poly-AI Framework

Implemented a deployable polymorphic Linux/AI framework for adaptive GitHub workflow automation:
- `poly_framework.py`: Core engine that discovers, ranks, and selects tools
- `poly_framework.md`: Documentation for the framework
- `.github/workflows/poly-ci.yml`: GitHub workflow for the poly framework

## 4. Qwen Setup Steps

Created a detailed Qwen setup guide:
- Prerequisites
- Installation steps
- Best practices for code generation
- Example workflow

## Next Steps

1. Run the sentiment analysis project locally to ensure it works correctly
2. Create a GitHub repository for the project
3. Push the code to GitHub
4. Set up the cron job for automatic weekly updates
5. Begin planning the next project (computer vision or time series forecasting)

## Long-term Goals

- Build 1 project per month showcasing different AI/ML skills
- Contribute to open-source AI/ML projects
- Write technical blog posts about your projects
- Network with other AI/ML professionals on GitHub
